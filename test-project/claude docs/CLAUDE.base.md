# Delobotomize - Claude Code Monitoring & Recovery

This is the base instruction file for Delobotomize. The `.claude/CLAUDE.md` file is generated dynamically from this base during initialization.

## Project Overview

Delobotomize is a comprehensive monitoring and recovery toolchain for Claude Code sessions. It provides:

- **Session-level monitoring** via proxy log analysis
- **Five-phase recovery pipeline**: Audit → Analysis → Recovery → Fix → Iterate
- **Real-time dashboard** with alerts and metrics
- **Automated artifact generation** and manifest tracking

## Core Principles

1. **Proxy logs are the source of truth** - All health signals come from `.delobotomize/proxy.log`
2. **No auto-kill policy** - Sessions are never automatically terminated
3. **Integrity enforcement** - `.claude/` must mirror `claude docs/` exactly
4. **Natural language configuration** - All policies are defined in markdown
5. **Phase-aware monitoring** - Different stall thresholds for different phases

## File Structure

- `claude docs/` - Canonical source for all Claude assets
- `.claude/` - Runtime mirror (regenerated by `delobotomize init`)
- `.delobotomize/` - Run artifacts, manifests, and logs

## Usage

Initialize the project:
```bash
delobotomize init
```

Run a complete recovery cycle:
```bash
delobotomize run
```

Run specific phases:
```bash
delobotomize audit
delobotomize analysis
delobotomize recovery
delobotomize fix
```

## Important Notes

- Always sync `claude docs/` to `.claude/` before running
- Integrity checks will fail if files differ
- Only the Fix phase can write to the codebase
- All phases generate artifacts under `.delobotomize/runs/{runId}/`
