ARCHITECTURAL INSPIRATION

The design and methodology of this project was inspired by the following
open-source projects. We studied their architecture and implemented our own
versions based on their approaches. No code was copied; these projects served
as architectural references and design inspiration.

1. multi-agent-workflow by Apolo Pena
   - Repository: https://github.com/apolopena/multi-agent-workflow
   - License: MIT
   - Copyright: © 2025 Apolo Pena
   - Inspiration: Hook-based monitoring system architecture
   - Our Implementation: monitoring/server/ and monitoring/hooks/

2. claude-code-proxy by Aaron Miller
   - Repository: https://github.com/aaronmiller/claude-code-proxy
   - License: MIT
   - Copyright: © 2025 Aaron Miller
   - Inspiration: API proxy pattern and logging methodology
   - Our Implementation: proxy/server.py

We are grateful to these developers for creating excellent reference
implementations that helped shape our architectural decisions.
